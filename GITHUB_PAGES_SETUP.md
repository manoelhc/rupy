# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## Current Status

The modern single-page HTML documentation has been created in the `gh-pages` branch locally. The file `index.html` contains a beautiful, fully-featured documentation site built with Tailwind CSS.

## What Has Been Done

✅ Created `gh-pages` branch
✅ Created `index.html` with modern documentation
✅ Merged changes from `copilot/create-single-page-html` into `gh-pages`
✅ Verified the file exists in the `gh-pages` branch

## What Needs to Be Done by Repository Owner

Due to authentication restrictions, the `gh-pages` branch needs to be pushed manually:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages
```

Then enable GitHub Pages:
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Select `gh-pages` branch as source
3. Select `/ (root)` folder
4. Click Save
5. Visit https://manoelhc.github.io/rupy/ after a few minutes

## Alternative: Manual Setup

If the above doesn't work, you can:
1. Checkout the `copilot/create-single-page-html` branch
2. Copy `index.html` to a new orphan `gh-pages` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout --orphan gh-pages
   git rm -rf .
   git checkout copilot/create-single-page-html -- index.html
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages documentation"
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```
3. Enable GitHub Pages as described above

## File Location

The documentation file can be found in the `copilot/create-single-page-html` branch as `index.html`.
